# Python and Machine Learning

My personal repository for learning python and machine learning. 

## [Linear Model and Regularization with sklearn](https://github.com/Argaadya/python_ml/tree/main/Linear_Model)

Exploring laptop specification data and build linear model to predict the laptop price based on the attributes of the laptop from various brands. Build regularization model with L1, L2, and Elastic Net as a way to improve the model ability to generalize pattern and reduce variance. Contain python machine learning implementation with `sklearn` and `pyspark`.
